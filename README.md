# Data_Structures_Implementation
This repository holds generic implementation (with type safety) of the following interfaces and data structures:

List

ArrayList

LinkedList (with functionality limited to List)

Queue

LinkedList (with full functionality)

Stack

## Starter Files
Each data structures includes a directory with starter files that users can use to implement the data structures on their own. Exception handling will be taken care of for users so they can focus on the internal workings of each data structure, and not worry about subtle error messages.

## Solutions
The solution for each data structure is posted at the same level as where the "Starter Files" directory is kept.
